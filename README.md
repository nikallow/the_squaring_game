## About this project
One day, while programming [a Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html), I came up with the idea to write a game where you need to square numver at speed.  
Of course, the code may not be good (I haven't read much of the book, despite the fact that I started this project a month ago LOL), but I liked the creation of the project itself.
